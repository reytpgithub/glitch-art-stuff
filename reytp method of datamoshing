# The avidemux-only datamosh method

	
  First of, you WON'T need anything other than Avidemux itself. Once you have that, import your 2 videos (using open and
append). Now switch the video mode to MPEG-4 ASP (Xvid) and go to Frame. Where it says Maximum Consecutive B-frames, make that number 0. Next go to Quantizer and switch the Max/Min B-frame quantizer to 1. Save this as a datamosh preset by pressing the Save As button then typing in the window "datamosh" (If you will datamosh again, do that). Save the video, and open it again. Make the video mode Copy, and cut out the 2nd I-frame by using [ and then a right arrow and then ]. (and if you imported multiple videos, cut out the other I-frames from the 2nd one on). Click save, and click No on You may need smart copy. Use it?. If you click yes, I-frames will be inserted where you cut them. We don't want that, do we? It saves really quick and then you can use it in a YTP. For the smear, You open one video (or the datamosh you just made) and select the frame at the end by going [ then the right arrow then ]. For a fast smear, just do []. Now do Ctrl+C and keep pressing (or holding down) Ctrl+V for as long as you want. Make sure the video mode is Copy, like the last time. Then click save.
